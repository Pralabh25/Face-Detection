1. Developed a face detection project utilizing the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) method with
Python and the dlib library.
2. Utilized OpenCV to handle image processing tasks and extract facial features for detection.
3. Implemented a custom function to detect faces in images and draw bounding boxes around them, providing a visual representation of the detected faces.
4. Integrated the project with Google Colab for cloud-based development andÂ collaboration
